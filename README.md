# Drona-Python-Assignment
## Problem Statement 1

You are tasked with developing a Python program that simulates the movement of a drone using the Turtle module. The program should be designed to allow the drone to move in four directions: forward, backward, left, and right.

Requirements:
1. Utilize the Turtle module for graphical representation.
2. Design functions that control the drone's movement: move_forward, move_backward, move_left, and move_right.

## Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/AkshitRaizada/Drona-Python-Assignment.git
cd Drona-Python-Assignment
python3 Q1.py
```
Press any button to make the drone appear. The buttons shown below correspond to the Cartesian directions.

Moving around:
q    w    e
a    *    d
z    x    c
Up/Down
2 - UP
s - DOWN

```
python3 Q1_triangle.py
```
I have provided another file for question 1 which demonstrates the working of the program more clearly. This is because the turtle module cannot change the dimensions or rotation of the .gif image file used in the program.

## Problem Statement 2

Develop two Python programs that can send and receive messages to each other using TCP sockets.

Requirements:
1. Create a sender program (sender.py) and a receiver program (receiver.py).
2. The sender program should be able to establish a TCP connection and send messages to the receiver.
3. The receiver program should be able to accept incoming connections and display received messages.
4. Implement error handling for socket operations.

## Instructions
```
python3 Q2_receiver.py
```
In a different terminal window:-
```
python3 Q2_sender.py
```
Type your message in Q2_sender.py's terminal and it should be received on the other terminal. Type e to exit.
